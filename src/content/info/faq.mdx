## Materials and Care

<Spacing size="sm" />

<Expandable title={"How should I take care of my jewellery?"}>
  Sterling silver that is worn regularly requires less care so we encourage you to wear it daily. You may clean your jewellery with a polishing cloth to help maintain or bring back its shine. You can also use mild soap, rinse the silver thoroughly in warm water and then dry carefully. 
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  Avoid contact with perfume, skincare and other harsh chemicals to help reduce tarnishing. Remove your jewellery when doing household chores, showering, swimming and other physical activities to prevent tarnish as much as possible.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  When you’re not wearing your piece, you can store it in the box provided in a cool, dry place. Always store your pieces individually so that they do not get scratched. 
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"What is the plating used on your sterling silver pieces?"}>
  Our sterling silver pieces are plated with either rhodium or 14k gold to provide a protective layer against tarnishing. All our pieces are hypoallergenic, lead-free and nickel-free so they are suitable for sensitive skin.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"How to restore your oxidised sterling silver pieces?"}>
  You may restore your oxidised sterling silver pieces at home with baking soda, aluminium foil, a bowl/glass dish and boiling water by following the steps below.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  1. Layer the bottom of a bowl / glass dish with aluminum foil, making sure that the shiny side of the foil is facing upwards. This bowl should be deep and large enough so that your silver can be completely submerged in it.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  2. Ensure that your silver has maximum contact with the aluminium foil.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  3. Add a little bit of baking powder to the bowl / glass dish.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  4. Add enough boiling water to immerse the silver for about a minute.
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  5. Rinse the silver thoroughly in water and then dry carefully with a soft cotton cloth or microfiber cloth.

## Moissanite FAQ

<Spacing size="sm" />

<Expandable title={"What is a moissanite?"}>
  Moissanite is a naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide. It was first discovered by a French scientist, Henri Moissan, found inside of a meteorite crater. As moissanite is extremely rare, moissanite used in fine jewellery is created in a lab.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"How long can moissanite last?"}>
  Moissanite is a 9.25 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, just behind diamond which is a 10. Its durability makes moissanite resistant to scratching and abrasion, an ideal gemstone for daily wear and lasts a lifetime.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"How brilliant is a moissanite?"}>
  Brilliance reflects the ability of a gemstone to reflect white light and how much it sparkles. Moissanite’s superior refractive index means that it has brilliance higher than a diamond, making it the most brilliant gem in the world. 
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"What is moissanite fire?"}>
  Also known as dispersion, moissanite emits more fire or flashes of rainbow-coloured light than diamond.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"What are the moissanite grades?"}>
  Similar to diamonds, moissanite is graded based on the GIA diamond grading scale. Moissanite color grades are broadly split into three groups: colourless (D-E-F grade), near-colourless (G-H-I grade), and yellow tinted (J-K grade). All our moissanite gemstones are D grade with VVS1 clarity.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"How does moissanite compare to diamonds?"}>
  Diamond and moissanite are ultimately different types of gemstones - moissanite is made of silicon carbide whereas diamond is made of carbon. Moissanite has greater brilliance to diamonds and can cost approximately 1% of an equivalent mined diamond in terms of size and clarity. We consider moissanite as a diamond alternative, rather than an imitation. 
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  To the naked eye, moissanite and diamonds are virtually indistinguishable. The most visible difference is that moissanite reflects rainbow-coloured lights when direct light passes through as it is more brilliant than a diamond.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"How does moissanite compare to cubic zirconia?"}>
  Cubic zirconia is a diamond simulant that is made to look like a diamond. Cubic zirconia is more affordable and accessible than moissanite. 
  <Spacing size={"sm"} />
  Its rating on the Mohs Scale of Hardness is 8.5; although it is still durable, it does not compare to the hardness of moissanite or diamonds, making it less resistant to chipping or breaking. Moissanite also has greater brilliance, fire and luster compared to cubic zirconia. 
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"Can moissanite pass as a diamond using a diamond tester?"}>
  Absolutely! Moissanite will pass as a diamond when using a diamond tester that detects thermal conductivity. All our moissanite pieces are individually tested using our diamond tester before they are shipped to you.
