Clair - clarity in terms of our gemstones and also our purpose. We are an ethical and sustainable luxury jewellery brand, accessible to all. Minimal but meaningful, our signature collection features our carefully selected moissanite gemstones and similar to diamonds, a moissanite is forever. 

<Spacing size={"sm"} />

Every single moissanite gemstone by Clair comes with a limited lifetime warranty against defects in material or workmanship of the moissanite gemstone. Our pieces are crafted with durable materials such as 925 sterling silver and solid gold, making it last for years to come.

Proud to be a minority and female-led brand, we hope to empower and celebrate women in all their forms. Treating customers fairly is at the heart of everything we do - this means high quality jewellery, first-rate customer service and fair pricing for you.

## My Story

<Spacing size={"sm"} />

I started Clair as a passion project when I was struggling to find a diamond alternative that is affordable and kind to the planet. Our moissanite gemstones are lab grown and conflict-free which means no blood diamonds or cartel pricing with our moissanite jewellery. I am committed to promoting sustainable and ethical jewellery so our products are long-lasting and we are working hard to reduce our carbon footprint.  Part of our promise is to be genuine in sharing our inspirations, constantly striving to learn and be better.

## Our sustainability journey

<Spacing size={"sm"} />

Our mission is to deliver ethical, sustainable and affordable jewelleries with minimal environmental impact. We believe we have a responsibility to the planet and we are committed to be as environmentally friendly as possible. Our products are made to last and we offer a one year warranty on all our pieces. We only use lab grown moissanite gemstones and diamond simulants, meaning it is ethical, sustainable, eco-friendly and lasts a lifetime. There is definitely more we can do and we are working hard behind the scenes to improve our sustainability journey.
