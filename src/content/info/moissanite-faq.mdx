<Expandable title={"What is moissanite?"}>
Moissanite is a naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide. It was first discovered by a French scientist, Henri Moissan, found inside of a meteorite crater. As moissanite is extremely rare, moissanite used in fine jewellery is created in a lab.

<Expandable title={"How long can moissanite last?"}>
Moissanite is a 9.25 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, just behind diamond which is a 10. Its durability makes moissanite resistant to scratching and abrasion, an ideal gemstone for daily wear and lasts a lifetime.

<Expandable title={"How brilliant is moissanite?"}>
Brilliance reflects the ability of a gemstone to reflect white light and how much it sparkles. Moissanite's superior refractive index means that it has brilliance higher than a diamond, making it the most brilliant gem in the world.

<Expandable title={"What is moissanite fire?"}>
Also known as dispersion, moissanite emits more fire or flashes of rainbow-coloured light than diamond.

<Expandable title={"What are the moissanite grades?"}>
Similar to diamonds, moissanite is graded based on the GIA diamond grading scale. Moissanite color grades are broadly split into three groups: colourless (D-E-F grade), near-colourless (G-H-I grade), and yellow tinted (J-K grade). All our moissanite gemstones are D grade with VVS1 clarity.

<Expandable title={"How does moissanite compare to diamonds?"}>
Diamond and moissanite are ultimately different types of gemstones - moissanite is made of silicon carbide whereas diamond is made of carbon. Moissanite has greater brilliance to diamonds and can cost approximately 1% of an equivalent mined diamond in terms of size and clarity. We consider moissanite as a diamond alternative, rather than an imitation.
<Spacing size={"sm"} />
To the naked eye, moissanite and diamonds are virtually indistinguishable. The most visible difference is that moissanite reflects rainbow-coloured lights when direct light passes through as it is more brilliant than a diamond.

<Expandable title={"How does moissanite compare to cubic zirconia?"}>
Cubic zirconia is a diamond simulant that is made to look like a diamond. Cubic zirconia is more affordable and accessible than moissanite.
<Spacing size={"sm"} />
Its rating on the Mohs Scale of Hardness is 8.5; although it is still durable, it does not compare to the hardness of moissanite or diamonds, making it less resistant to chipping or breaking. Moissanite also has greater brilliance, fire and luster compared to cubic zirconia.

<Expandable title={"Can moissanite pass as diamond using a diamond tester?"}>
Absolutely! Moissanite will pass as diamond when using a diamond tester that detects thermal conductivity.
